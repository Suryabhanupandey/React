### 🔹 Component
A component is a reusable piece of UI written as a JavaScript function that returns JSX.  
Components help divide a user interface into small, manageable, and reusable parts.

**Examples:**  
- Button  
- Card

Props (properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.  
They make components **dynamic** and **reusable**.

**Example:**

<Button value="Login" />
